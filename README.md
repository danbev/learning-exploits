### Reading out of bounds
Reading out of bounds only causes a crash in certain situations, which usually
depend on the type of memory allocator being used. A segfault is caused when
reading into a memory page which the current process is not allowed to read.

Whether this read continues into such a protected page mostly depends on two
factors:
1) Rounding of the allocator
Most allocators (such as the one in GNU libc) have buckets (linked lists) for
various memory sizes, which are used to keep track of free memory. So when you
call malloc(10), you might actually get a buffer of 16 bytes. In this case, an
out of bound reads will not cause any sideeffects (in regards to segfaults).

2) Guard Pages
Memory allocators use guard pages to catch out of bound accesses (some even have
a guard page after every memory block allocated), so for a crash to happen, we
would need to read into one of these.

Besides that, an out of bound reads might also lead to an information leak, eg
iving an attacker information about a part of the memory that would normally not
be accessible. I didn't investigate this option for this case.
