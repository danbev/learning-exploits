### Python in exploits
Python is used in exploits and the most common way I've see it used is to
generate the input arguments to a program.  One reason for this is that there
is a python module named [struct](https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html)
that has a nice function named `pack`.

This is handy when one has an address in hex and want to include it in a string.
This will require the hex values to be individually escaped using `\xNN`, which
means insert the characters whose hex value is NN. There is also the issue with
endienness and this is something that the pack function can handle using a
format string.

For example:
```python
rip = pack('<L', 0x00007ffff7e33cb0);
```

Now, addresses in lldb are displayed in hex in the format 0x00007ffff7e33cb0. If
we want to store that value in a string so that we can overwrite the value on
the stack we need to
