## Common Vunerability Scoring System (CVSS)
This score indicates the severity of an information security vunerability.

The following is a nice diagram for understanding the scoring:

## Common Vunderabilties and Exposure (CVE)
Is a list of publicly disclosed vunerabilities that include a CVE ID, a
description, dates, and comments.

A CVE identifier follows the format of CVE-{year}-{ID}. A CVE Numbering
Authority (CNA) assigns these numbers. For example, HackerOne is a CNA
Once a vulnerability is reported, the CNA assigns it a number from the block of
unique CVE identifiers it holds and the CNS then reports this number to MITRE.

## National Vunerability Database (NVD)
Is a database maintained by NIST, which is synchronized with the CVE list.
