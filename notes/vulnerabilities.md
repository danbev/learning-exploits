## Common Vunerability Scoring System (CVSS)
Was created my MITRE and has a scale from 0.0-10.0 and the most recent version
is CVSSv3 which was released in 2015.

This score indicates the severity of an information security vunerability.

The following is a nice diagram for understanding the scoring:
https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide#Scoring-Rubrics

## Base score
The base score deals with qualities/details that do not depend on things like
time or the environment of the vulnerability. Like it does not say anything

This base score depends on three subscores which follow.

### Exploitability subscore
This subscore describes how easliy an attack can be carried out.

#### Attack Vector (AV)
How close does an attacker have to be to perform the attack. Does one need to
be close to the computer system or can it be done remotely.
A high score would be given if the attack and be run remotely and a low score
if one needs to be physically close to the system.

* Network (AV:N) Remotely exploitable via the network stack.

* Adjancent Network (AV:A) limited to the same physical or logical network,
cannot be accessed through a router.

* Local (AV:L) the vulnerable component is not exposed via the network stack
but instead requires to be logged in to be able to attack.

* Physical (AV:P) the attacker needs to physically touch the component that is
under attack, like attaching a peripheral device or something.


#### Attack Complexity (AC)
How hard/easy is it to perform the attack, like what information, if any, does
the attacker need to be able to carry out the attack.
* Low (AC:L)  nothing has to be done to carry out the attack
* High (AC:H) would be set if the attack depends on things that is out of the
attackers control. So the attack cannot just but done but there needs to be
time and effort invested on the attckers part to be able to perform the attack.

#### Privileges Required (PR)
Does the attack require special previleges? 
* None (PR:N) the attacker is non-authorized after the attack.
* Low (PR:L) the attacker is authorized but with a normal users priveledges.
* High (PR:H) the attacker is authorized with previledges like admin/root.

#### User Interaction (UI)
Does the attack depend on some action of a user of the system, like does something
need to be installed by a user for this attack to be carried out. 
* None (UI:N) the system can be exploited without any interaction from the user.
* Required (UI:R) before the attack can be carried out some interaction from a
user is required, for example clicking a link in an email.


### Impact subscore
How does a carried out attack impact the attacked system. Is there an increased
access level gained by the attack for example.

#### Confidentiality (C)
Has private/secret data been exposed. 
* None (C:N) no loss of confidentiality within the impacted component
* Low (C:L) low which indicates that there was some loss
* High (C:H) where there was total loss (is this like a completely leaked
database, or privatekey/passwords)?

#### Integrity (I)
Has the attacked tampered with data so that it cannot be trusted. This can be
* None (I:N) These is no loss of integrity
* Low (I:L) modification of data is possible but the attacker does not have
control over the consquences of the modification. 
* High (I:H) for example the attacker is able to modify any files protected by
the impacted component.

#### Availablity (A)
This score is score is about the availability of the program attacked and if
it it's avilablilty was affected. None if there was no change, low if there
might be some change in the availability, for example this might be DOS attack
where the performace of the system is degraded but not totally unreachable.
High would be when perhaps a crash or the service of a DOS attach where the 
system is unresponsive.

* None (A:N) the impacted component functions like before
* Low (A:L) the impacted component has reduced or interrupted but not completly
down.
* High (A:L) the component is down and not accessible for others to use.

### Scope subscore (S)
This scope include things (systems, components) around the system/component
that was attacked. Through the attack is the attacker able to exploit other
components/systems apart from the attacked system itself.
* Unchanged (S:U) the attach only affects the attacked component.
* Changed (S:C) the attack can affect other resources.

### Temporal Score
These are things that can change over time as work is done by the vendor or
reporter to improve the situation.

#### Exploit code maturity (E)
Describes how easy it is to reproduce the attack.
* Not Defined (E:X)
* Unproven that exploit exists (E:U) Only theoretical exploit
* Proof of concept (E:P) but might not be directly exploitable by attackers
* Functional exploit exists (E:F) 
* High (E:H)

#### Remidation Level (RL)
Describes what can be done to fight off the attack.
* Not Defined (RL:X)
* Official Fix (RL:0) patch or upgrade available from vendor
* Temporary Fix (RL:T) official but temp fix from vendor
* Workaround (RL:W) unofficial, non-vendor provided 
* Unavailable (RL:U) no solution of impossible to apply
* Official fix

#### Report Confidance (RC)

* Not Defined (RC:X)
* Unknown (RC:U) there are reports that indicate there is a vuln but the cause
is currently unknown.
* Reasonable (RC:R) reasonable confidance that the bug is reproducable and
at least one impact is able to be verified.
* Confirmed (RC:C)

### Environmental Score 
These are things that are related to the specific users organisation. This
takes into consideration where the component effected by the attach is in
a users environment. Like there might be a report of an exploit but it might
be more difficult to exploit depending on the location of a server (for example).

#### Attack Vector (MAV)
These are the same values as in the Base score metric's Attack Vector but now
specific to a users organization.

* Not Defined (MAV:X) this will not change the base score.
* Network (MAV:N) Remotely exploitable via the network stack.
* Adjancent Network (MAV:A) limited to the same physical or logical network,
cannot be accessed through a router.
* Local (MAV:L) the vulnerable component is not exposed via the network stack
but instead requires to be logged in to be able to attack.
* Physical (MAV:P) the attacker needs to physically touch the component that is
under attack, like attaching a peripheral device or something.


#### Attack Complexity (MAC)
* Not Defined (MAC:X) this will not change the base score.
* Low (MAC:L)  nothing has to be done to carry out the attack
* High (MAC:H) would be set if the attack depends on things that is out of the


#### Privilegeds Required (MPR)
* Not Defined (MPR:X) this will not change the base score.
* None (MPR:N) the attacker is non-authorized after the attack.
* Low (MPR:L) the attacker is authorized but with a normal users priveledges.
* High (MPR:H) the attacker is authorized with previledges like admin/root.


#### User Interaction (MUI)
* Not Defined (MUI:X) this will not change the base score.
* None (MUI:N) the system can be exploited without any interaction from the user.
* Required (MUI:R) before the attack can be carried out some interaction from a
user is required, for example clicking a link in an email.

#### Scope (MS)
* Not Defined (MS:X) this will not change the base score.
* Unchanged (MS:U) the attach only affects the attacked component.
* Changed (MS:C) the attack can affect other resources.

#### Confidentiality Impact (MC)
* Not Defined (MC:X) this will not change the base score.
* None (MC:N) no loss of confidentiality within the impacted component
* Low (MC:L) low which indicates that there was some loss
* High (MC:H) where there was total loss (is this like a completely leaked
database, or privatekey/passwords)?

With this there is also a Confidentiality Requirement (CR) subscore:
* Not Defined (CR:X) this will not change the base score.
* Low (CR:L) likely affect only limited affect on the orgs employees/customers
* Medium (CR:M) serious affect only limited affect on the orgs employees/customers
* High (CR:H) catastrophic affect only limited affect on the orgs employees/customers

#### Integrity Impact (MI)
* Not Defined (MI:X) this will not change the base score.
* None (MI:N) These is no loss of integrity
* Low (MI:L) modification of data is possible but the attacker does not have
control over the consquences of the modification. 
* High (MI:H) for example the attacker is able to modify any files protected by
the impacted component.

With this there is also a Integrity Requirement (IR) subscore:
* Not Defined (IR:X) this will not change the base score.
* Low (IR:L) likely affect only limited affect on the orgs employees/customers
* Medium (IR:M) serious affect only limited affect on the orgs employees/customers
* High (IR:H) catastrophic affect only limited affect on the orgs employees/customers

#### Availability Impact (MA)
* Not Defined (MA:X) this will not change the base score.
* None (MA:N) the impacted component functions like before
* Low (MA:L) the impacted component has reduced or interrupted but not completly
down.
* High (MA:L) the component is down and not accessible for others to use.

With this there is also a Availability Requirement (AR) subscore:

* Low (AR:L) likely affect only limited affect on the orgs employees/customers
* Medium (AR:M) serious affect only limited affect on the orgs employees/customers
* High (AR:H) catastrophic affect only limited affect on the orgs employees/customers


## Common Vunderabilties and Exposure (CVE)
Is a list of publicly disclosed vunerabilities that include a CVE ID, a
description, dates, and comments.

A CVE identifier follows the format of CVE-{year}-{ID}. A CVE Numbering
Authority (CNA) assigns these numbers. For example, HackerOne is a CNA
Once a vulnerability is reported, the CNA assigns it a number from the block of
unique CVE identifiers it holds and the CNS then reports this number to MITRE.

https://cve.mitre.org/cve/

## National Vunerability Database (NVD)
Is a database maintained by NIST, which is synchronized with the CVE list.
