## Common Vunerability Scoring System (CVSS)
Was created my MITRE and has a scale from 0.0-10.0 and the most recent version
is CVSSv3 which was released in 2015.

This score indicates the severity of an information security vunerability.

The following is a nice diagram for understanding the scoring:
https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide#Scoring-Rubrics

### Base score
The base score deals with qualities/details that do not depend on things like
time or the environment of the vulnerability. Like it does not say anything


#### Attack Vector (AV)
How close does an attacker have to be to perform the attack. Does one need to
be close to the computer system or can it be done remotely.
A high score would be given if the attack and be run remotely and a low score
if one needs to be physically close to the system.


#### Attack Complexity (AC)
How hard/easy is it to perform the attack, like what information, if any, does
the attacker need to be able to carry out the attack.
A lower score would be given if the attacker needs to do work to get additional
information to carry out the attack and a higher score if there is nothing needed.

#### Privileges Required (PR)
Does the attack require special previleges? A low score would be where something
like admin previledges is required to carry out the attack. A higher score if
not required.

#### User Interaction (UI)
Does the attack depend on some action of a user of the system, like does something
need to be installed by a user for this attack to be carried out. This is a
yes or no answer and not a scale (binary).



## Common Vunderabilties and Exposure (CVE)
Is a list of publicly disclosed vunerabilities that include a CVE ID, a
description, dates, and comments.

A CVE identifier follows the format of CVE-{year}-{ID}. A CVE Numbering
Authority (CNA) assigns these numbers. For example, HackerOne is a CNA
Once a vulnerability is reported, the CNA assigns it a number from the block of
unique CVE identifiers it holds and the CNS then reports this number to MITRE.

## National Vunerability Database (NVD)
Is a database maintained by NIST, which is synchronized with the CVE list.
