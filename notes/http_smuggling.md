## HTTP Smuggling
Is an exploint that can be preformed when there are proxies in front of
services (load balancer/reverse proxy), like is often the case in cloud
environments and normal deployments to distribute load.

The idea is that a user sends a request to the proxy and the proxy will
send requests. Each connetion to the loadbalancer/reverse proxy will be a
separate connection as the clients can be from anywhere, but the connection
from the loadbalancer/proxy can use a single connection to the backend server
and send multiple requests over that connection.

The server needs to be able to find out where one request starts and the next
request begins.
